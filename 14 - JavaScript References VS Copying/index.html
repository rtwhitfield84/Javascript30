    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Richard';

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players];
    team[3] = 'me';

    const team4 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Richard',
        age: 32
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    console.log(person);
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 11});
    console.log(capt2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
